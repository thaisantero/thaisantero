### ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I am a graduate in civil engeneering and a master student in water resources engineering in the Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡. My research is focused on applying Machine Learning techniques in hydrological data.
- ðŸ‘€ Today, i am interested in entering in field of data science.
- I am currently looking for jobs as a data analyst or as a data scientist jr. As so, i am looking for opportunities and collaboration in projects related to data science and machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Machine Learning and SQL.

### Engeneering projects developed:

I have two projects in R that i used to help in my engeneering work, decreasing the operation time largely. They are:

Transform_Raster_Elevation
(https://github.com/thaisantero/Transform_Raster_Elevation)

Water_consumption_calculation
(https://github.com/thaisantero/Water_consumption_calculation)

The rest of my projects can be found in my repositories.
