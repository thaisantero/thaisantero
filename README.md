### ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I am a civil engineering graduate and a master's student in water resources engineering at the Universidade Federal do CearÃ¡. My research is focused on applying Machine Learning techniques to hydrological data.
Today, I am interested in entering the field of TI as a backend developer.
I am currently looking for backend developer courses that can make me join a company as a junior backend dev.

#### Programming languages I have already worked on: Python, R, MySQL.

### Engeneering projects developed:

I have two projects in R that I used to help in my engineering work, decreasing the operation time vastly. They are:

Transform_Raster_Elevation
(https://github.com/thaisantero/Transform_Raster_Elevation)

Water_consumption_calculation
(https://github.com/thaisantero/Water_consumption_calculation)

The rest of my projects can be found in my repositories.
